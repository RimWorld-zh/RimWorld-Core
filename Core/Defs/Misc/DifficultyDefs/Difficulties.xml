		<description>Apply mastery of every RimWorld skill for just a chance to survive a harrowing trial against a cruel, unfair world.\n\nRecommended for: Players who want to face brutal, unfair situations that require the deployment of fluent and well-rounded skills and the sacrifice of treasured people just to avoid losing everything.\n\nThere is no clean game here. You'll spend a lot of time fighting wounded and recovering, you'll need to prepare carefully, and you'll need to sacrifice people and things you love. Unfair challenges and capricious death may come to you at any time. This level is about dealing with losses, because preventing them is impossible.</description>
